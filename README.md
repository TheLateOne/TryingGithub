# TryingGithub

This is a collection of programs, hosted on GitHub for my own personal benefit. There are some mathematically based
programs, a golf score card type program and a program which grabs stock prices at a defined period in order to create
an inter-minute data set. I will also host the data sets here for public usage and over time I will probably expand
to a fairly large subsection of the FTSE 100 or some personalised subsection.
