# TryingGithub

This is a collection of programs, hosted on GitHub for my own personal benefit. There are some mathematically based
programs, a golf score card type program and a program which grabs stock prices at a defined period in order to create
an inter-minute data set. I will also host the data sets here for public usage and over time I will probably expand
to a fairly large subsection of the FTSE 100 or some personalised subsection.

Remember when entering tickers that they must adhere to the Yahoo Finance format. That means if it's based on an
exchange other than the NYSE it will likely have a following letter to identify it's exchange (such as "L" for the LSE).
